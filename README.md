# Image_Classification
Hyperspectral data is widely used for the analysis of remotely sensed images and it includes hundreds of number of bands. Machine learning techniques are widely used in classification of remotely sensed data.Data was acquired by the ROSIS (Reflective Optics System Imaging Spectrometer) sensor during a flight campaign over Pavia, northern Italy. 
The number of spectral bands is 103 for Pavia University. Pavia University dataset contains 610*340 pixels.The geometric resolution is 1.3 meters and ground-truth consist 9 classes.
